Routr is designed to help bike commuters find the best bike routes available to get to where they're going.

Ideas:
Implement Djikstra's algorithm with GIS data to find the shortest route between bike paths.

Future Ideas:
Identify areas of bike inefficiencies & contact representatives based on zip code!
Currently just want something to get you around.
Explore with weighting Djikstra's to prefer bike lanes, avoid busy roads, and no hills
Seasonality: Swap to paved paths in winter.

Preferences page:
What kind of paths you prefer, what you'd like to avoid, can you do hills, type of bike you have, etc.

Sightseeing option, find routes around a city (madison, boulder, etc) to see specific things you want!

8/26/2025:
- For tomorrow: create a GitHub repo and learn to manage privately.
- Work with GIS data to get what I need and set up more classes/objects.
- Install OSMNx to get street map data (more scalable to other cities vs local city data)
- Create account, play with packages.
